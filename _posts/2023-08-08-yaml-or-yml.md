My guess is that you're reading this post because you're wondering whether choosing one of the above naming conventions over the other will affect your work.

To be honest, this is a matter of personal opinion, which is why I categorized this as **opinion**.

What would I choose? I'll name my file as **YAML**.

Why?

Because there was a time when we had this argument about *htm/html*, and today, there's seldom a page that still has the *.htm* extension.

Go with *.yaml*.

The rest of the world, who choose *.yml* because their [code might break on older systems otherwise](https://dev.to/derek/so-is-it-yaml-or-yml-lh2#comment-aamh), or [because it's 25% faster](https://dev.to/derek/so-is-it-yaml-or-yml-lh2), will eventually catch up.

However, I must point out, at this very last minute, that it doesn't matter which you use; what matters more, is whether your code is properly structured.
Is **YAML** *Yet Another Markup Language*, or *YAML Ain't Markup Language*?

**That's topic for another post!**.
