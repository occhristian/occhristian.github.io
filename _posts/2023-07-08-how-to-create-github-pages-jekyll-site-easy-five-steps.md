			<p>You want to have a site/blog of your own, and for some reason, you want to do it the hard way.</p>

			<p><strong>I wrote this post for you.</strong></p>

			<p>So let&apos;s get this right.</p>
			<blockquote>The aim of this post is to show you the easiest (and fastest) means to install Jekyll on a Github Pages site.<br>
			If you want just a Github Pages site, there is a more detailed tutorial for that <a href="#">here</a>.</blockquote>

			<h2 id="outline">What do we want to do?</h2>
			<ul>
				<p>We want to:</p>
				<li>Create a repo on Github for our site</li>
				<li>Clone that repo to our PC, because that is where we will do our installation</li>
				<li>Install Jekyll to the repo we just cloned</li>
				<li>Modify our config files, and finally,</li>
				<li>Push our changes back to Github.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Really! That&apos;s how simple it is, and you should have a blog in about 20 minutes! Ready?</strong></p>

			<h2 id="create-github-repo">Create a repo on Github</h2>
			<p>To create a Github Pages site, you need to create a repository that has the same name as your username. For example, if your github username is occhristian, then the name of your repository will be OCCHRISTIAN.GITHUB.IO
			</p>
			<p>This will also serve as your website/blog address.</p>


			<h2 id="clone-github-repo">Clone the repo to your PC</h2>
			<p>Next, you need to clone the repository you just created, to your PC.<br>
			Navigate to your repository, and click on the green CODE button.</p>
