You want to have a site/blog of your own, and for some reason, you want to do it the hard way.

**I wrote this post for you.**

> The aim of this post is to show you the easiest (and fastest) means to install Jekyll on a Github Pages site.<br>
If you want just a Github Pages site, there is a more detailed tutorial for that [here](#).

## What do we want to do?

We want to:

* Create a repo on Github for our site
* Clone that repo to our PC, because that is where we will do our installation
* Install Jekyll to the repo we just cloned
* Modify our config files, and finally,
* Push our changes back to Github.

**Really! That's how simple it is, and you should have a blog in about 20 minutes! Ready?**

## Create a repo on Github

To create a Github Pages site, you need to create a repository that has the same name as your username. For example, if your github username is occhristian, then the name of your repository will be OCCHRISTIAN.GITHUB.IO

This will also serve as your website/blog address.

## Clone the repo to your PC

Next, you need to clone the repository you just created, to your PC.<br>

Navigate to your repository, and click on the green CODE button.

## Install Jekyll

...and that, my friends, is how you do it!

You have just unlocked a new world of possiblities with Jekyll and Github!<br>

There will be other posts on the matter on this blog.
