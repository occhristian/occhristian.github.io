# 🚀 Getting Started with Trojan Bot

I like simple tutorials.

If you can explain something in 10 minutes, why take an hour?

By the time you get to the end of this tutorial, you'll:
- Have a brand new wallet
- Learn how to secure it
- Know how to buy and sell Solana memecoins

…all without leaving Telegram.

This tutorial should only take about 10 minutes to read through.

I’ve done my best to include only what you NEED to know — no fluff, no installations, and no payment required.

> **Disclaimer:** I’m not affiliated with Telegram or Trojan Bot. I just use both tools. You can support me by using my [referral link](https://t.me/achilles_trojanbot?start=r-cwxander) to sign up or purchase the **Advanced Trojan Features with Telegram** course.

## 🧠 Introduction

Things happen **very fast** in crypto.

One second can make a huge difference. I learned the hard way while using Phantom to trade tokens on DEX platforms.

You're still filling out the form, and boom — the price has already changed.

Ever tried refreshing Phantom and it still shows the old price while the token is crashing or mooning?

That all changed for me when I discovered **Trojan Bot** in 2024.

There are other bots (Maestro, Bonkbot, SolSniper, etc), but Trojan Bot feels like home. I know every button and shortcut like the back of my hand.

And now… I’ll show you how to use it too.

## 📦 Create a Fresh Wallet

To create a fresh wallet, click here to open Trojan Bot:  
👉 [@TrojanBot](https://t.me/achilles_trojanbot?start=r-cwxander)

You might need to click the "Start Bot" button (1), and then you should see a screen like (2):

![Welcome screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dked0ofts/image/upload/v1755586007/trojan-bot-telegram-tutorial-images-1_qc5ggz.png)

Tap **Continue** on the welcome message.

Then you’ll see a screen like this:

![Create wallet screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dked0ofts/image/upload/v1755587486/trojan-bot-telegram-tutorial-images-2_sll98t.png)

That’s it — your wallet has been created!

Let’s secure it next.

## 🔐 Secure Your Wallet

⚠️ There are **two things you must NEVER share** with anyone:

- Your **private key**
- Your **mnemonic phrase**

Trojan Bot will show you your **private key** right after creating your wallet (3).

Copy it immediately and save it somewhere **safe** — not on cloud storage.

As long as you're the only one who has it, your funds are secure.

📌 You can also read my full [Security Tips for Crypto Wallets](#) guide.

Now, tap **Start Trading**, and you’ll be greeted with the screen on the right:

## 💰 Fund Your Wallet

You’ll need some SOL to trade.

You can fund your wallet using:
- P2P platforms like Binance
- Local crypto exchangers in your area

If you're new and unsure how to proceed, feel free to [DM me on Telegram](https://t.me/cwxand3r) and I’ll walk you through it.

## 🛠️ Buy Tokens — As Simple As Pasting a CA and Hitting SEND

Here’s where the fun begins.

To buy any token:
1. Copy the token’s **contract address (CA)**
2. Paste it into the chat with Trojan Bot
3. Hit **Send**

Trojan will display token info like this:

![Token details screen](https://your-cdn-link.com/trojan-token-preview.png)

Then:
- Just type how much **SOL** you want to spend
- Hit **Send** again

That’s it — the bot will buy the token for you instantly.

🧪 Want more control?

1. Tap **Limit**
2. Adjust slippage, gas, buy delay, etc
3. Tap **Swap**
4. Then **Buy**

## 💸 Sell Tokens — Even Simpler Than Buying

Selling is even easier.

At the top of your token screen, you’ll see:

- **Sell 50%**
- **Sell 75%**
- **Sell 100%**

Tap the one that matches how much you want to sell.

![Sell token buttons](https://your-cdn-link.com/trojan-sell-buttons.png)

💡 Want to sell a custom amount?

Tap **Sell X**, type the % you want to sell, and press **Enter**.

Done.

## 🔚 Conclusion / What’s Next?

### ✅ Summary:
- Open the bot
- Create a wallet
- Secure your private key
- Paste a token CA and buy
- Tap a button to sell

🕒 All in under 10 minutes.

But that’s just the beginning.

There’s still more to explore:
- Setting slippage and gas manually
- Auto-buy / auto-sell
- Token sniping
- Wallet tracking / copy trading

> ⚠️ **Crypto is risky.** You can make a lot of gains… but also lose a lot.

Start small. Practice with test amounts. As you build confidence, scale up slowly.
