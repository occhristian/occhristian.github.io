# 🚀 Getting Started with Trojan Bot

I like simple tutorials.  
If you can explain something in 10 minutes, why take an hour?  
By the time you get to the end of this tutorial, you'll:
- Have a brand new Solana wallet address with one of the best Telegram crypto bot
- Learn how to secure your new wallet
- Know how to buy meme tokens (Solana), and how to sell them for profit
- Become proficient in Solana trading

…all without leaving Telegram.

This tutorial should only take about 10 minutes to read through.  
I’ve done my best to include only what you NEED to know — no fluff, no installations, and no payment required.

## 🧠 Introduction

Things happen **very fast** in crypto.

One second can make a huge difference. I learned the hard way while using DEX wallets (Solflare, Phantom, etc) to trade tokens on DEX platforms.

You're still filling out the form, and boom — the price has already changed.  
Ever tried refreshing Phantom and it still shows the old price while the token is crashing or mooning?

That all changed for me when I discovered **Trojan Bot** in 2024.

I have tried other bots (Maestro, Bonkbot, SolSniper, etc), and while they're good, I believe [Trojan Bot](https://t.me/achilles_trojanbot?start=r-cwxander) has the most features and an intuitive UI, is normie-friendly, and for me, feels like home. I know every button and shortcut like the back of my hand.

And now… I’ll show you how to use it too.

Do you have Telegram? Then you're ready to begin!

## 📦 Create a Fresh Wallet

To create a fresh wallet, click here to open Trojan Bot:  
👉 [@TrojanBot](https://t.me/achilles_trojanbot?start=r-cwxander)

You might need to click the "Start Bot" button (1), and then you should see a screen like (2):

![Welcome screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dked0ofts/image/upload/v1755586007/trojan-bot-telegram-tutorial-images-1_qc5ggz.png)

Tap **Continue** on the welcome message.

Then you’ll see a screen like this:

![Create wallet screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dked0ofts/image/upload/v1755587486/trojan-bot-telegram-tutorial-images-2_sll98t.png)

That’s it — your wallet has been created!

Let’s secure it next.

## 🔐 Secure Your Wallet

⚠️ There are **two things you must NEVER share** with anyone:

- Your **private key**
- Your **mnemonic phrase**

Trojan Bot will show you your **private key** right after creating your wallet (3).

Copy it immediately and save it somewhere **safe** — not on cloud storage.

As long as you're the only one who has it, your funds are secure.

📌 You can also read my full [Security Tips for Crypto Wallets](#) guide.

Now, tap **Start Trading**, and you’ll be greeted with the screen on the right (5).

## 💰 Fund Your Wallet

Time to fund your wallet.  
For everything you do on the Solana blockchain, you will need SOL.

You can fund your wallet using:
- P2P platforms like Binance
- Local crypto exchangers in your area

If you're new and unsure how to proceed, feel free to [DM me on Telegram](https://t.me/cwxand3r) and I’ll walk you through it.
Simply copy your wallet address (5) and send some SOL to it.

## 🛠️ Buy Tokens — As Simple As Pasting a CA and Hitting SEND

Here’s where the fun begins.

To buy any token:
1. Copy the token’s **contract address (CA)**
2. Paste it into the chat with Trojan Bot
3. Hit **Send**

To demonstrate, I copied a random CA and used as an example.
Trojan will display token info like this:

![Token details screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dked0ofts/image/upload/v1755587980/trojan-bot-telegram-tutorial-images-3_mikv5u.png)

Then:
- Just type how much **SOL** you want to spend
- Hit **Send** again

That’s it — the bot will buy the token for you instantly.
If your wallet SOL balance is less than buy amount + tx fees (~0.0006SOL), the transaction will fail (see image on the right).

🧪 Do you want more control?

1. Tap **Limit** (this will prevent the bot from sending the transaction before you're done adjusting parameters)
2. You can adjust slippage, buy amount, 
3. Tap **Swap**
4. Then **Buy**

## 💸 Sell Tokens — Even Simpler Than Buying

Selling is even easier.  
Tap the **Menu** button at the bottom left of the screen  
Tap the **View detailed information about your tokens** option  
(or type ```/positions``` in the prompt and **Send**)  
The list of tokens you have in your wallet will be displayed. For example:

At the top of your token screen, you’ll see:

- **Sell 50%**
- **Sell 100%**

Tap the one that matches how much you want to sell.

💡 Want to sell a custom amount? No problem!  
Tap **Sell X**, type the % you want to sell, and press **Enter**.

Done.
